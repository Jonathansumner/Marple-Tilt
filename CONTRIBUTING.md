## Creating Good Issues 
* When creating new issues, it is important to add an appropriate issue title in the present tense, i.e. "create draw layering functionality" that accurately discribes the goal of the issue so that it is less likely for 2 issues to be created for the same goal. 
* It is also imperative to correctly label the issue so that contributors can see which aspect of the project this applies to, likewise it is important to assign a contributor to the issue so that others may see what each contributor has done to further the project. 
* Finally, it is necessary to assign a completion date for the issue for project management reasons so that the project may be completed on time.


## Creating Pull Requests
* When creating a pull request, it is important to leave a meaningful and descriptive commit message so that the person reviewing the pull request can easily tell what is being changed.
* Furthermore, it is essential to assign a reviewer to check over the code before the pull request is approved so that they may check if there are any merge conflicts first. 
* Pull requests must also be correctly labelled so that the reviwer may again easily distinguish the aspect of the code base that will be affected.
